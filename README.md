## Project Description
![need initial image](/assets/Images-Gifs-Videos/Password-Generator-Main.PNG)

For this project I was tasked with create a quiz game using basic JavaScript. I required to do the following:

- Create a start screen:
  - Must include link to the highscores page
  - Include the title of the game
  - Include a timer (set to 0 initially)
  - Description of the game and how to play
  - Start button that begins the activity
- When the start button is pressed:
  - ask at least 5 questions, post the final score, store the final score and user initials, and post the highscores on a separate page.

## Installation

Prerequisites\: None

Simply clone it from my repo\:

```

## Roadmap

In the future I plan to incorporate jquery to shrink my code. I also hope to create an eventlistner that reads all of the question buttons instead of having 4.

## Acknowledgements

For this project I would like to thank the following individuals\:

- John Young\: For introducing me to the joys of Javascrip, pointing out the importance of scope when declaring variables, and inspiring me to use let and const when possible instead of var.
- Dan Mont-Eton\: For the calm and patient support he provided in understanding my code and "talking me off the ledge" when I wanted to throw my computer at the wall. For also helping me find simple errors/solutions to tasks that I spent hours on.
- Zachary Auerbach for helping me debug my code to get my data to store properly
